####  What is it?
Abstraction for working with caching.

Currently only the [InMemory](https://github.com/php-service-bus/cache/blob/v5.0/src/InMemory/InMemoryCacheAdapter.php) adapter is available. For a custom adapter, you must implement the [CacheAdapter](https://github.com/php-service-bus/cache/blob/v5.0/src/CacheAdapter.php) interface.
